Simple Jupyter notebook designed to visualize the Federal Reserve Balance Sheet.  Thanks to Wolf Richter over at wolfstreet.com for the inspiring article when the Fed actually [started the QE unwinding](https://wolfstreet.com/2017/11/02/fed-begins-balance-sheet-normalization/).

Here are some other links that talk about it:

* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-20/fed-asset-shrinking-to-start-next-month-rate-hike-seen-in-17)
* [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/26/the-fed-is-about-to-make-balance-sheet-change-how-it-works.html)
* [Business Indider](http://www.businessinsider.com/fed-wants-to-decrease-balance-sheet-gradually-but-path-will-be-rocky-2017-7)
* [Bankrate.com](http://www.bankrate.com/banking/federal-reserve/fed-balance-sheet-and-your-bottom-line/)

So did they actually keep their promise ??   They sure did.  Boom!  $11.5B  - gone as of Dec 31, 2017.
